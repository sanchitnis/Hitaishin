## What This Is

The **Hitaishin** is a Claude AI *skill* — a structured coaching system that turns Claude into a deeply grounded personal coach for graduates of Jnana Prabodhini (JP), the Pune-based gifted-education institution founded in 1962 on the philosophy of Swami Vivekananda.

JP alumni are unusually formed individuals: high-IQ, trained from school age in leadership, steeped in Advaita Vedanta, the Bhagavad Gita, the teachings of Sri Aurobindo, Samarth Ramdas, and Maharshi Dayananda — and carrying a deep conviction that their education was given in service of India's renewal. They are now navigating demanding professional lives, family responsibilities, and national contribution.

This coaching system serves them at the intersection of all three.

In conversation, the AI coach identifies itself as **Hitaishin**. At the start of a session it gives
a short introduction, and if asked "what can you do?" or "how do I use this?" it provides a concise
capability and usage guide.

## Who This Is For

| Audience | What You'll Find Here |
|----------|----------------------|
| 👤 **JP alumni / users** | A personal AI coach available any time — for daily planning, weekly review, purpose-finding, and life balance |
| 🎓 **Domain experts** (coaches, educators, philosophers) | A structured coaching curriculum to review, validate, and enrich with deeper wisdom |
| 💻 **Developers / engineers** | An open skill framework to extend with scripts, integrations, and automation |

> **Not a JP alumnus but curious?** The underlying frameworks — Five Spheres, GTD with Sankalpa-alignment, AI delegation architecture — are broadly applicable to any purpose-driven leader. The philosophical grounding is Indian and specific; the structure is universal.

## What It Does

The skill activates a **six-agent coaching system** inside Claude:

```

It also includes:

- **3 psychometric web apps** (run in any browser, no backend) — Character Strengths, Five Spheres Balance Wheel, Organizational Attitude Leadership Profile
- **Full GTD task management** in Markdown files — with sphere-tagging, Sankalpa alignment, and AI delegation
- **AI delegation architecture** — 5 specialised AI agents (Research, Drafting, Planning, Inbox, Review) that handle work the human shouldn't be doing
- **Complete onboarding lifecycle** — intake interview protocol → psychometrics → synthesis → living mentee profile

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1 — Download the skill

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanchitnis/hitaishin.git
```

Or download the [latest release ZIP](../../releases).

### Step 2 — Install in Claude

1. Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) → click your profile icon → **Settings**
2. Go to **Features** → **Skills**
3. Click **+** → **Create Skill** → **Upload ZIP**
4. Zip the `hitaishin` folder and upload it

> see [Alternative Usage](#alternative-usage-without-skills) below.

### Step 3 — Start your first session

In any Claude conversation, just say:

```
Coach me using the Hitaishin
```

Or try:
```
I want to start my coaching intake — I'm a JP alumnus ready to onboard
```
```
Help me plan my day using the Five Spheres
```
```
Run a Sunday Svadhyaya review with me
```
```
Apply the Purushartha filter to this task: [describe a decision]
```

## Alternative Usage (Without Skills)

If you don't have a plan that supports Skills:

1. Open the file `SKILL.md` in this repository
2. Copy its entire contents
3. Paste it as the first message in a new Claude conversation
4. Attach any reference files you want Claude to know about
5. Then proceed with your coaching session

This works but requires manual setup each conversation. The Skills feature automates this.

## The Philosophical Foundation

The coaching system is grounded in four wisdom traditions JP synthesises:

| Tradition | Core Contribution |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Advaita Vedanta** (Upanishads) | Non-dual identity — you are not only your roles |
| **Bhagavad Gita** | Svadharma, Nishkama Karma, Sthitaprajna |
| **Swami Vivekananda** | Man-Making Education, Organizational Attitude |
| **Sri Aurobindo** | Integral Yoga — all life as transformative practice |
| **Samarth Ramdas** | Practical activism; Dasabodha wisdom |
| **Maharshi Dayananda** | Scientific temper within Vedic tradition |

Layered with Western coaching science: ICF competencies, Positive Psychology (Seligman), Adaptive Leadership (Heifetz), Logotherapy (Frankl), Immunity to Change (Kegan), and Positive Intelligence (Chamine).
